----VARIABLES
variable: space in memory
num = 3 inside num i put the 3 object
the identifier can't start whith a number, always lowercase words, 
    in the case of two words or more, separate them with an underscore

----TRASFORM DATA
int() transform to an integer
str() transform to a string

----LOGIC AND COMPARISON OPERATORS
'and' compares if two values are true.
or compares if any of the values is true
not inverts the value of the boolean.
== Compare two values and tell you if they are the same or not.
! = Compare two values and tell you whether they are different or not.
> Compare if it is greater than another value.
> Compare if it is less than another value.
> = equal to or greater than the value to compare.
<= equal to or less than the value to compare.

----SLICES
name = "Francisco"
name
"Francisco"

name [0: 3] // Start from the first index to before the 3rd index.
"Fra"
name [: 3] // Goes from the beginning to before reaching the 3rd index. since there is no parameter in the first place,
     it is interpreted that it starts from the beginning.
"Fra"

name [1: 7] // Start from index 1 to before 7.
"rancis"
name [1: 7: 2] // Starts from index 1 to before 7, but steps from 2 by 2, since that is what it tells us
     Number 3! parameter, which is 2.

name [1 :: 3] // Starts from index 1 to the end of the string (as there is no 2nd parameter, it means that it goes to the end),
     but in steps of 3 by 3.
"rcc"

name [:: - 1] // As there is no parameter in the first 2 places, it is interpreted that it starts from the beginning to the end,
     but in steps of 1 by 1 with the word backwards, because it is -1.
"ocsicnarF"


----PALINDROME
* if __name__ == '__main__':  // this is called "the entry point"
    run()

1- Create the function 'run' and inside create 'word' whis is a variable that contains an input 
    "Write a word" 
2- After tha into a variable called is_palindrome save the function 'palindrome(word)' which receive a word
3- Continue with a condicional 
4- go to function 'run' and quit all the spaces from the word received and convert to lowercase with the 'lower' function
5- Create another varible 'backward_word' which should reverse the 'word'
6- finally do a comparison between word and backward_word if this two elements are equal return True 
    else return False.
